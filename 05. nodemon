npm install nodemon --save-dev             //We need this nodemon only during development. Not during production.



NODEMON:
Nodemon is a tool which is widely used and which tracks changes and automatically restarts the application. 
If we do not use Nodemon then after each change we have to stop the application and run it again.


Check package.json file.
In script field, type "start":"nodemon app.js" and save it.

In Terminal, type npm start.
So everytime when we save the code, it restarts.
