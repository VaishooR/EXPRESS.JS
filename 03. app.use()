--> app.use() is an expressjs function using which we can add middlewares, used to send response and handle requests. 
              if use() function is used, the express doesnot send its own response. It expects us to type the request.

--> Middleware: It's a function that holds the request object, the response object, and the middleware function. 
                It is the code that is used to handle the requests.
                Middleware is used to manipulate request.
                It is middleware because it is a function that run between request and response cycle.
                Middleware is like pipeline which end with response object.
                Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
                Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
                    Execute any code.
                    Make changes to the request and the response objects.
                    End the request-response cycle.
                    Call the next middleware in the stack.



Example:

const express= require('express');
const http= require('http');

const app= express();
app.use(()=>{ 
    console.log('Express works...')
})

const server=http.createServer(app);
server.listen(3000);
