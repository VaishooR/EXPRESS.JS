In Node.js:
const http= require('http');
const server=http.createServer(app);
server.listen(3000);

Instead in Express.js:
app.listen(3000);




app.listen():
app. listen() function which Binds and listens for connections on the specified host and port.
The Express app.listen() method creates an http server object and then configures it to receive incoming TCP connections on a specific port and IP address so that when clients request a connection to that port and send an http request, the server can receive that http request and process it, sending a response. 

In node we use http module seperately using which we create server and listen to it. 
app.listen() doesnot require this http module.
